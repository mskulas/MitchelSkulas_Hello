Levels 1-3 are completed

AI use was limited to adding JavaDoc comments, and any other usage was done line by line with copilot's predictive text feature.

As for the prompt, I pasted the code into copilot and typed:
"Please add JavaDoc comments for the public classes and methods in this code."
I then minimally altered it to denote optional parameters and created the JavaDoc files with the javadoc command, available in the JavaDoc folder.
